> As of August 18, 2024, SkASWM has been archived and is no longer under active development.
>
> This decision was made due to the lack of usage, with only a few people utilizing Slime World Manager within Skript. The project was primarily created as a learning experience in developing Skript addons, and it has successfully served that purpose. While the project is now archived, all previous releases will remain accessible, and the latest release should continue to function without any issues.
